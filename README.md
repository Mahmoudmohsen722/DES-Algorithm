# DES-Algorithm
Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm  
# Commands to run
Encryption: des.exe encrypt plain.txt key.txt cipher.txt (plain.txt & key.txt are INPUTS and cipher.txt is OUTPUT)  
Decryption: des.exe decrypt hex.txt key.txt decrypted.txt (hex.txt & key.txt are INPUTS and decrypted.txt is OUTPUT)  
  
"Input must be a multiple of 8-Bytes"
